<h1>Projects Overview</h1>
<p>A project in Code on the Go contains everything that defines your workspace for an app, from source code and assets to test code and build configurations.</p>
<p>Here's a random image because we need to test an image:</p>

<p>When you start a new project, Code on the Go creates the necessary structure for all your files and makes them visible in the Project window. To open the Project window, swipe right on the screen or tap the upper-left menu. </p>

<p>This page provides an overview of the key components inside your project.</p>
<h1>Modules</h1>
<p>A module is a collection of source files and build settings that let you divide your project into discrete units of functionality. Your project can have one or many modules, and one module can use another module as a dependency. You can independently build, test, and debug each module. <a href="modules_top.html">Learn more about modules.</a></p>

<p>Additional modules are useful when creating code libraries within your own project or when you want to create different sets of code and resources for different device types, such as phones and wearables, but keep all the files scoped within the same project and share some code. Some common modules are described below.</p>

<tr><td>Library modules</td>
<td>Library modules provide a container for your reusable code, which you can use as a dependency in other app modules or import into other projects. Structurally, a library module is the same as an app module, but when built, it creates a code archive file instead of an APK, so it can't be installed on a device.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Android app modules</td>
<td>e modules provides a container for your app's source code, resource files, and app-level settings, such as the module-level build file and Android Manifest file. When you create a new project, the default app module is named "app." Common modules are described below. Learn more about modules.</td>

<h1>Project files</h1>
<p>By default, Code on the Go displays your project files in the Android view. This view is organized by modules and file types to simplify navigation between key source files of your project and hides some files or directories that are not commonly used.</p>

<p>Files are organized in the following way:</p>

<table style="font-size: 12px;">
  <tr>
    <th>File type</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>manifests</td>
    <td>Contains the AndroidManifest.xml file. Learn more about manifests.</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>java</td>
    <td>Contains the Kotlin and Java source code files, separated by package names, including JUnit test code.</td>
 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>res</td>
    <td>Contains all non-code resources, such as UI strings and bitmap images, divided into corresponding subdirectories. For more information about possible resource types, see App resources overview</td>
 </tr>
